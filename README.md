# AI Resume Builder 📄

Welcome to the **AI Resume Builder**, an innovative application that leverages cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) and API integrations to create professional, ATS-friendly resumes in minutes!

> **Presented at:** Code Sprint Workshop, **RVITM**
>
> **Purpose:** Demonstrating the power of LLMs and APIs in real-world applications.

## 🔍 About the Project
This project showcases how AI, specifically LLMs, can be integrated into applications to automate complex tasks like resume writing. The AI Resume Builder simplifies the process of creating tailored resumes by:

- Accepting personal details, education, experience, skills, and job descriptions.
- Using the Groq API with LLaMA-3 model to generate professional, concise resumes optimized for ATS systems.
- Offering download options in PDF format or copying the resume directly to the clipboard.

This project serves as a live demonstration of how APIs can be harnessed to create intelligent, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

## 🔧 Features
- **Customized Resume Creation**: Tailor resumes based on user inputs and job descriptions.
- **PDF Export**: Download your generated resume as a PDF.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Copy the resume content to your clipboard for easy use.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive interface.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of API keys using environment variables.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for web interface
- **Groq API** with LLaMA-3 model for AI-powered text generation
- **FPDF** for PDF creation
- **dotenv** for environment variable management

## 🕹þ How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmarYaksambi/Simple-Resume-Builder
cd Simple-Resume-Builder
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key:
```env
api_key=your_groq_api_key_here
```

4. **Run the Application**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🌍 How It Works
1. **Input Your Details**: Fill in personal information, education, experience, skills, and the job description.
2. **Generate Resume**: Click the **"Generate Resume"** button and let the AI do its magic.
3. **View & Download**: Preview the generated resume, download it as a PDF, or copy it to your clipboard.
